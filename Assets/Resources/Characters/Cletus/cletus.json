    "backstory": "Born to resident Alabamans, Wade is a fair-haired, warm-eyed and friendly, sun-kissed face. He grew up on his parents’ farm, helping at the estate, being the 8th set of arms. Mother, being of outdated views, spent most of her time in the kitchen, sewing, or doing other womanly work around the house together with her five girls. Wade was left to his father’s supervision. Little Wade since learning to walk hung round the garage touching the equipment. The boy at eight knew much of tractors and mechanics, being an assistant to his father, while he was tinkering with farm machinery. Mr Barnett – warm and infectiously positive man – thought nothing of letting the child to the field works, driving around the farmlands, sowing and cultivating the crops during school days and summers. Being the only men in the estate made their bond stronger. Past few years merciless weather ended many crops, decreasing the yield. Farm machinery needed repairing and money was scarce. The farm had to be mortgaged. Odd jobs were enough to bring bread and butter to the table, but restoring crops required financial aid.",
